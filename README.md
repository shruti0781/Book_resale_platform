# 📚 Library Management System (LMS)

The **Library Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the operations of a library. It allows librarians to manage books, users to search and borrow books, and both users and admins to handle fine payments online.

This project follows the **Scrum model of Agile development**, with features implemented incrementally in multiple sprints. The first sprint focuses on developing a secure and responsive **Payment Page**.
